# Expert System for Gaza Post-War Building Assessment

[**üåê Access the Deployed App**](https://building-assessment-es.streamlit.app/)

This project implements a rule-based expert system to assist engineers in assessing post-war building conditions in Gaza. The system evaluates various structural, environmental, social, and utility-related factors to prioritize actions for reconstruction, repair, or temporary solutions.

## Features
- **Rule-Based Inference:** Implements 31 rules to assess building conditions based on predefined criteria.
- **Uncertainty Handling:** Confidence levels for rules like cracks and radiation ensure accurate prioritization.
- **Prioritization Mechanism:** Outputs are ranked by severity and relevance.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A professional Streamlit-based web UI for easy accessibility and decision-making.
- **Robust Testing:** Includes tests for individual rules, combined scenarios, and edge cases.

## Project Structure
- **`src/`**: Contains the main expert system implementation.
  - `building_assessment_ES.py`: Contains the rule-based logic of the expert system.
  - `building_assessment_UI.py`: Implements the Streamlit-based user interface for easy input and results visualization.
- **`test/`**: Includes all test cases and the notebook for validation.
  - `testing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for individual and combined rule testing.
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation and supporting files.
  - `Preliminary Report - Challenges of Post-War Building Assessment in Gaza.pdf`: Preliminary report.
  - `Building Assessment Expert System - Guidelines.pdf`: Project instructions.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:
- **Streamlit:** For building the web-based user interface.
- **Custom Fork of Experta:** A modified version of the `experta` library to ensure compatibility with Python 3.10+. The fixed version replaces `frozendict` with `immutabledict` and is installed automatically via:
  ```plaintext
  git+https://github.com/WalidAlsafadi/experta.git


## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/WalidAlsafadi/BuildingAssessment-ExpertSystem>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install experta
   ```
## Usage
### Running the Expert System via the UI

1. Launch the Streamlit UI:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/building_assessment_UI.py
   ```
2. Follow the interactive interface to input building conditions and view prioritized actions.

### Running the Expert System via Python

1. Import the system into your script:
   ```bash
   from src.building_assessment_ES import BuildingAssessment, BuildingAssessmentExpertSystem
   ```
2. Define input facts and run the engine:
   ```bash
   engine = BuildingAssessmentExpertSystem()
   engine.reset()
   engine.declare(BuildingAssessment(hazardous_zone=True, overcrowding=True))
   engine.run()
   engine.print_prioritized_actions()
   ```

## Testing
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `test` folder:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook test/testing.ipynb
   ```
2. Run individual and combined scenario tests.
3. Validate the outputs in the notebook.

## How It Works
- The expert system uses a rule-based inference engine with 31 predefined rules.
- Users input building conditions via the UI, which are converted into facts for the system to process.
- Based on the rules and priorities, the system provides actionable recommendations.
