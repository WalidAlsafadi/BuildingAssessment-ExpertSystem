    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An **expert system** is a type of computer program designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert. It uses a combination of logic, rules, and knowledge representation to provide intelligent responses to queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of an Expert System\n",
    "1. **User Interface**:\n",
    "   - Acts as the communication bridge between the non-expert user and the expert system.\n",
    "   - Enables users to input queries and receive advice or decisions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Inference Engine**:\n",
    "   - The \"brain\" of the expert system.\n",
    "   - Applies logical reasoning to the rules and facts in the knowledge base to derive conclusions.\n",
    "   - Handles both forward and backward chaining to determine results based on inputs or goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Knowledge Base**:\n",
    "   - Stores the domain-specific knowledge provided by experts.\n",
    "   - Includes facts, rules, and heuristics that form the foundation for decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Architecture**\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates how these components interact in an expert system:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Expert System Architecture](https://www.scaler.com/topics/images/forward-and-backward-chaining-in-ai-1.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Workflow**\n",
    "1. The **user** inputs a query through the **user interface**.\n",
    "2. The **inference engine** processes the query, consulting the **knowledge base** to evaluate facts and rules.\n",
    "3. The system provides intelligent advice or recommendations back to the user.\n",

    "### <span style='color:dodgerBlue; font-weight:bold;'>Forward Chaining</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Forward Chaining?\n",
    "Forward chaining is a reasoning method used in expert systems. It starts with a set of known facts and applies rules to derive new facts or conclusions iteratively. The process continues until no more rules can be applied or a specific goal is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. **Initial Facts**:\n",
    "   - The system begins with a predefined set of facts.\n",
    "2. **Rule Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - The inference engine evaluates all rules to determine if any are satisfied by the current facts.\n",
    "3. **Fact Addition**:\n",
    "   - If a rule is satisfied, the conclusion of the rule is added to the knowledge base as a new fact.\n",
    "4. **Iteration**:\n",
    "   - The process is repeated until no more rules are applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "1. **Facts**:\n",
    "   - `Fact 1: Building has cracks.`\n",
    "   - `Fact 2: Cracks are wide.`\n",
    "2. **Rules**:\n",
    "   - If \"Building has cracks\" AND \"Cracks are wide,\" THEN \"Immediate repairs are needed.\"\n",
    "3. **Inference**:\n",
    "   - The system uses the above facts and rules to infer that \"Immediate repairs are needed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates the flow of forward chaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Forward Chaining Workflow](https://www.scaler.com/topics/images/forward-and-backward-chaining-in-ai-2.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Efficient for problems where all possible conclusions are needed.\n",
    "- Useful for generating a complete set of results based on known inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case in Expert Systems\n",
    "In the **Building Assessment Expert System**, forward chaining is used to derive safety-critical actions based on observable facts such as structural damage, water contamination, or environmental hazards.\n",

    "To validate the **Building Assessment Expert System**, we initialize the environment and define helper functions to streamline the testing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Import Required Components:**  \n",
    "   - Load the necessary classes and methods from the expert system (`building_assessment_es.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Helper Functions:**  \n",
    "   - Create the `test_rule` function to automate the testing of individual rules.\n",
    "   - Create the `test_combined_rule` function to handle combined scenarios with overlapping facts.\n",
    "   - Create the `test_edge_case` function to handle borderline or conflicting input conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prioritization Mechanism:**  \n",
    "   - Implement logic to evaluate and display results based on predefined priorities, ensuring outputs are both meaningful and easy to interpret."

    "### What is Backward Chaining?\n",
    "Backward chaining is a reasoning method used in expert systems that starts with a specific goal and works backward to determine if the required conditions are satisfied. The process recursively evaluates subgoals until either all conditions are met, or a failure is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. **Goal Identification**:\n",
    "   - The system begins with a specific goal or hypothesis.\n",
    "2. **Condition Verification**:\n",
    "   - The inference engine checks if the conditions required for the goal are satisfied.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - If conditions are not satisfied, the system recursively verifies subconditions or subgoals.\n",
    "4. **Success or Failure**:\n",
    "   - The process stops when all conditions are satisfied (success) or when some conditions cannot be resolved (failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "1. **Facts**:\n",
    "   - `Fact 1: Water contamination detected.`\n",
    "   - `Fact 2: Water access is disrupted.`\n",
    "2. **Rules**:\n",
    "   - If \"Water contamination detected\" AND \"Water access is disrupted,\" THEN \"Immediate water sanitation is required.\"\n",
    "3. **Inference**:\n",
    "   - The system uses the above facts and rules to infer that \"Immediate water sanitation is required.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagram\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates the flow of backward chaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Backward Chaining Workflow](https://www.scaler.com/topics/images/forward-and-backward-chaining-in-ai-7.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Efficient for goal-driven problems where a specific conclusion is required.\n",
    "- Reduces the number of rules evaluated by focusing only on relevant conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case in Expert Systems\n",
    "In the **Building Assessment Expert System**, backward chaining is used to verify if specific safety-critical actions (e.g., structural repairs, water sanitation) are needed by tracing back through dependencies to check if all required conditions are met.\n",

    "Backward chaining is implemented to evaluate whether the system can achieve a specific goal by working backward from the desired action. It recursively verifies the conditions required to achieve the goal and ensures that all dependencies are resolved.\n",

    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Test the system's ability to resolve goals based on predefined rules and facts.\n",
    "2. Evaluate how the system handles missing or conflicting conditions.\n",
    "3. Verify that the goal is achieved only when all required conditions are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Input:** Provide the goal action and corresponding facts or fallback defaults.\n",
    "- **Output:** Observe whether the system achieves the goal and the steps it takes to resolve conditions.\n",
    "- **Validation:** Ensure that:\n",
    "  - The system resolves all dependencies for the goal.\n",
    "  - Appropriate success or failure messages are displayed based on the evaluation.\n",

    "   - The system effectively handled overlapping conditions and prioritized safety-critical actions.\n",
    "   - Combined rules were resolved logically, ensuring accurate prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Case Testing**:\n",
    "   - The system responded well to borderline inputs, such as values near confidence thresholds.\n",
    "   - Fallback actions (e.g., \"Further inspection required\") were triggered appropriately for missing or zero-confidence inputs.\n",
    "   - Conflicting inputs were resolved logically, demonstrating robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backward Chaining Testing**:\n",
    "   - Goals were resolved accurately when all required conditions were satisfied.\n",
    "   - Missing or unsatisfied conditions resulted in clear failure messages, aiding user understanding.\n",
