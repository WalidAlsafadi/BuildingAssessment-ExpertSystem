    "This notebook demonstrates the functionality of the **Building Assessment Expert System**, a rule-based system designed to assist in post-war building assessments. The system evaluates building conditions and provides actionable recommendations based on predefined rules.\n",

    "- Validate individual rules to ensure they trigger correctly for specific inputs.\n",
    "- Test combined scenarios to evaluate how the system handles overlapping conditions.\n",
    "- Analyze outputs to validate the system's prioritization logic.\n",

    "1. **Test Setup**: Prepares the expert system and defines helper functions for testing.\n",
    "2. **Individual Rule Testing**: Tests each rule independently to validate its functionality.\n",
    "3. **Combined Scenario Testing**: Simulates real-world scenarios with multiple overlapping conditions.\n",
    "4. **Results and Analysis**: Summarizes the findings and highlights any limitations or areas for improvement.\n"

    "1. **Import Required Components:**  \n",
    "   - Load the necessary classes and methods from the expert system (`building_assessment_es.py`).\n",
    "2. **Define Helper Function:**  \n",
    "   - Create the `test_rule` function to automate the testing of:\n",
    "     - Individual rules.\n",
    "     - Combined scenarios with overlapping facts.\n",
    "3. **Prioritization Mechanism:**  \n",
    "   - Implement logic to evaluate and display results based on predefined priorities, ensuring outputs are both meaningful and easy to interpret."

    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Individual Rule Testing:**\n",
    "   - All rules were successfully triggered and produced the expected outputs.\n",
    "   - No errors or inconsistencies were observed in the rule logic.\n",
    "2. **Combined Scenario Testing:**\n",
    "   - The system correctly handled multiple overlapping conditions, prioritizing actions as per the predefined priority map.\n",
    "   - Safety-critical actions (e.g., hazardous zones, high radiation) consistently took precedence over social and repair-related actions.\n",
    "   - Edge-case scenarios, such as conflicting high-priority rules, were resolved correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "The system demonstrated robust performance across all test cases. Prioritization logic ensured that critical needs, such as safety and immediate hazards, were addressed first. Rules related to social and infrastructure needs were triggered appropriately in secondary positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "The **Building Assessment Expert System** has been thoroughly tested and validated. It successfully evaluates both individual conditions and complex scenarios, providing clear, prioritized recommendations based on predefined rules. The inclusion of uncertainty handling enhances its decision-making capabilities, ensuring reliable outputs even with partial data."
